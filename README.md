# noaa-data

This is a repo of data collected from the sattelites NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 using my RTL-SDR v3 based groundstation. Satellites represent a collective achievement by humanity and their data should not be kept behind closed doors. The data here should be stitched together into one wav file before decoding and must be decoded with the NOAA-APT format.
